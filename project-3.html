    <p class="padding-2">This annual report design has a consistent flow and makes the reader want to keep reading, as very page has it’s own unique icon relating to the page’s content. Every icon remains consistent and isn’t too distracting from the text. The look and feel of this report truly captures the message CHEO wants to deliver.</p>
