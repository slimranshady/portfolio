  <h2>EB GAMES AD CAMPAIGN</h2>
  <p class="padding-2">This campaign design was created to promote the new trade deal that EB Games has. Gamers can now trade in their old games in exchange for something new. This project involved making web banners, news paper ads, and bus ads. The challenge of this project was to create a consistent ad that flowed both horizontally and vertically, in multiple locations and sizes.</p>

    <h3>The Proccess</h3>
  </center>
  <p class="padding-2">The main goal of this design was to attract the target audience with a clean, sleek, and witty concept. In oder to achieve this, the background was kept white, in order to keep the focus on the slogan and imagery.</p>

    <p class="padding-2">The imagery created for this campaign was produced using large scale photography. Each image has gaming equipment that could potentially be applicable to this campaign. The bunched up and tangled wires that form the shape of each image contrast well with the light, soft, vignetted background.</p>

    <h3>Web Banners</h3>
  </center>
    <p class="padding-2">Everything is in greyscale, except for the word the viewer should focus on. This allows the overall design to maintain its visual simplicity. The other reason the imagery is in greyscale is to avoid the many clashing colours produced within the gaming equipment. The imagery has a simple, iconic feel, while still having depth if one looks at it long enough. This technique draws the viewer in that much more.</p>
