  <h2>spidey title sequence</h2>
  <p class="padding-2">The goal for this title sequence was to portray our favourite web-slinger in a unique, fresh way. A fractal illustration that I made earlier this year is used as the main canvas. An aggressive guitar with a hard beat (shout out to my boy Childish Gambino) is used to go along with the sharp edges of the illustration.</p>
  <p class="padding-2">One of the obstacles for this project was to keep every frame consistent and cohesive. This was achieved by studying the other Marvel/Netflix series title sequences to see what they all had in common. This piece was made to be a metaphorical installment to Marvelâ€™s line of tv shows.</p>
