  <h2>beats package redesign</h2>
  <p class="padding-2">The main goal for this design was to create a package that is more environmentally friendly while still maintaining the look and feel of the company.</p>

    <h3>original packaging</h3>

    <h3>die cut</h3>

  <p class="padding-2">This package redesign achieves this goal because it has smaller dimensions, and since it’s shaped like the logo, it reduces it’s surface area even more. This means there are a lot less materials to use when constructing this box. The entire box is made up of coated card-stock, which is completely recyclable.</p>

  <p class="padding-2">A big challenge with this design was the roundness in the logo which had to be simulated within the shape of the package. The box is actually made up of simply a rectangle and hexadecagons. This simple solution allows the design to appear generally round, while still being completely sealed with a fitting lid. The base is extended so that it can easily stand on it’s own. The box can also be hung by the stem.</p>

  <p class="padding-2">Beats is a luxury brand, which makes their products, but more importantly their boxes, rare. This is why this cleaver design is a perfect solution for this product. This is the kind of box one might keep on their shelf after they’ve opened it. This lets the users benefit from this design emotionally.</p>
