  <h2>title sequences</h2>
  <p class="padding-2">The goal for this title sequence was to portray our favourite web-slinger in a unique, fresh way. A fractal illustration that I made earlier this year is used as the main canvas. An aggressive guitar with a hard beat (shout out to my boy Childish Gambino) is used to go along with the sharp edges of the illustration.</p>
  <p class="padding-2">One of the obstacles for this project was to keep every frame consistent and cohesive. This was achieved by studying the other Marvel/Netflix series title sequences to see what they all had in common. This piece was made to be a metaphorical installment to Marvel’s line of tv shows.</p>

  <p class="padding-2">This short retro title sequence was inspired by Stranger Things, Tron, and Ironman. The old retro feel in this video is achieved with many simple tricks, such as a low frame rate, a very subtle flicker, some slight colour-shifting, and some other things. You may recognize the font from the cover of Stephen King’s novel The Dead Zone.</p>
