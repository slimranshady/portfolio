  <h2>parallax: batman noir</h2>
  <p class="padding-2">This piece was made using nothing but one of my comic books called Batman Noir. The goal of this project was to showcase this comic in a unique, and attention-grabbing way. A simple parallax technique is used to bring the still images to life. Since the comic is printed in black and white, the colour scheme in the video remains the same.</p>
