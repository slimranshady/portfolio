    <h2>BEATS PACKAGE REDESIGN</h2>
        <p class="padding-2">The goal of this project was to recreate a package design that is not only more environmentally friendly, but one that is more attractive and unique. This package redesign for beats earbuds are shaped like the companyâ€™s logo, which is appealing for consumers, and they take up much less material than the previous packaging. Additionally, they include all of the information from the previous packaging.
