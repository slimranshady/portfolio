  <h2>SHADY MODERN: TYPE DESIGN</h2>
  <p class="padding-2">Beginning this project, the initial goal was to create a truly unique font. This was achieved by adding dents and triangles into the letters, which gives them and interesting, modern, geometric look.</p>

    <p class="padding-2">The initial challenges near the beginning of the project were making sure the strokes of the character are thick enough for printing in small sizes and for the final 3D print.</p>
    <p class="padding-2">Some obstacles faced later, while vectorizing the typeface, were the height of the characters. They initially looked fine on their own, but when put together, some errors in height relevance became more obvious. These were later fixed.</p>
